The Car Dealership Website is created with the purpose of displaying and advertising the latest car releases of a very specific Japanese RDM car brand. It does not visually overwhelm potential buyers by using minimalist UI design and functionality.
The website is divided into 3 scroll-snapping sections using the <section> element combined with JavaScript code. Additionally, a navigation bar is fixed to the top of the user's screen to assist with site navigation. When opening the webpage the user will be greeted with the first section, which is a dynamic fullscreen-wide video carousel (Best Practices for Carousels, 2021), showing three latest car releases of our brand. The second section focuses on telling the user about our brand, its history and the fact that our brand is more than just cars, but much rather a lifestyle. It is followed up by nice fade-in text and image animations. The third section is a footer, which contains links to all other web pages, as well as our brandâ€™s social media accounts. The website also has a navigation bar at the top of the screen to assist with the navigation. On the left side of the bar is a menu button, which opens up a list of links of all other web pages related to the website. Each link in the list comes with a hovering animation. In the middle stands the logo of our brand, which also acts as a clickable link that will take the user back to the homepage. On the right side of the bar is a Contact Us button, which opens a form with 2 following inputs: Name and Email. The form is backed up by JS code, ensuring that the email is valid and is actually usable.
